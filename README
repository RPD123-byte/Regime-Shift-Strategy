Algorithmic trading with semi-supervised learning

Introduction
Algorithmic trading has gained increasing popularity in financial markets due to its potential to automate trading strategies and capitalize on market inefficiencies but one area that has yet to be fully explored and semi-supervised learning applied to algorithmic trading. This project aims to address this gap and demonstrate how a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning can lead to robust and interpretable marketing strategies.

The Problem
The traditional approach to algorithmic trading is based on supervised learning processes, using historical data with recorded results to train predictive models. However, this approach has limitations, as it requires that multiple listings are used and can fail to capture underlying patterns in the market. Furthermore, the interpretation of complex models can be difficult, especially in financial markets where multiple factors influence property transactions

The Road to the Market
Semi-supervised learning offers an alternative solution to the challenges posed by purely supervised methods. By combining labeled and unlabeled data, semi-supervised learning can make better use of available data and reveal hidden patterns that may not be apparent with traditional supervisory methods.

Overcoming barriers with unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering have previously been explored for algorithmic trading. However, it faced challenges due to reliability and interpretability. The number of groups achieved by clustering can be unpredictable and difficult to define, especially when dealing with multiple clusters.

The Innovation
This work introduces a novel approach to overcoming the challenge of unsupervised learning in algorithmic trading. The main vision is to use clustering techniques to identify different regimes in the market. Instead of using cluster labels directly, we use them to create separate data sets for each regime. This allows each regime to be treated as an individual market situation with specific characteristics.

The Framework

The system consists of the following steps:

Use unsupervised clustering methods to identify market regimes.
Divide the data set into separate data sets for each regime.
Train the XGBoost Regressor on each regime-specific data set.
Compare the performance of the semi-supervised approach with a benchmark buy-and-hold strategy and a traditional supervised learning approach.
Results and conclusions
The results of this work demonstrate the effectiveness of a semi-supervised learning approach in generating profitable marketing strategies. By treating market regimes as separate environments, models can better adapt to changing market conditions.

Future directions
To further improve the study, future work could focus on the following areas:

In the proposed framework, a variety of unsupervised and supervised learning strategies should be tested.
Perform hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.
Explore the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically adjust trading strategies based on changing market regimes.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this work provides valuable insights into the potential of semi-supervised learning in the algorithmic trading domain. By combining the power of unsupervised and supervised learning, we can develop robust and interpretable trading strategies, ultimately improving profitability in financial markets.
